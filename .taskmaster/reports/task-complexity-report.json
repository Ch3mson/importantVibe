		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Configure shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of integrating shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS into the Next.js project into detailed implementation steps, including installation, configuration, theme setup, and verification tasks.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard library integration with clear documentation. The complexity is moderate due to potential configuration issues with tsconfig.json and path aliases, but the steps are well-defined and the task has no dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Main Layout Components",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for each layout component (Header, Footer, Main content container), including their responsive design requirements, styling approach, and component composition.",
			"reasoning": "Creating layout components requires design decisions and responsive considerations. The task is moderately complex as it establishes the foundation for the application's UI structure and depends on the shadcn/ui configuration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TranscriptInput Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the TranscriptInput component implementation into detailed steps covering the UI elements, JSON validation logic, error handling, state management, and user feedback mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "This component involves form validation, error handling, and state management for the JSON input. The complexity is higher due to the need for JSON validation and providing appropriate user feedback for various input states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Pagination Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for the Pagination component, including the UI elements, navigation logic, accessibility features, and keyboard support functionality.",
			"reasoning": "The pagination component requires state management and accessibility considerations. While not overly complex, it needs careful implementation of keyboard navigation and proper ARIA attributes for accessibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AnalysisDisplay Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the AnalysisDisplay component into detailed steps covering the layout structure, individual section components, responsive design considerations, and empty/loading states.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex component with multiple sections and conditional rendering logic. It needs to handle various data formats, implement responsive layouts, and maintain good UX across different states and screen sizes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Client-Side State Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of the state management system, including state structure definition, action creators, reducer functions, custom hooks, and integration with components.",
			"reasoning": "State management is inherently complex as it coordinates data flow throughout the application. This task requires careful design of state structure, actions, and reducers to handle multiple states including loading, errors, and pagination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Mock API Route",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the mock API route into detailed steps covering endpoint creation, request validation, response structure, error handling, and testing approaches.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a mock API involves defining data structures and handling requests/responses. The complexity is moderate as it requires TypeScript interfaces, validation logic, and simulating real-world API behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Connect Frontend to Mock API",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to integrate the frontend with the API, including service function implementation, state updates, loading state management, error handling, and end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "This integration task requires coordinating between the UI components and API services. The complexity comes from handling asynchronous operations, managing loading and error states, and ensuring proper data flow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate LLM with API Route",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLM integration process into detailed steps covering SDK setup, prompt engineering, API communication, response parsing, error handling, and optimization techniques.",
			"reasoning": "LLM integration is highly complex due to prompt engineering challenges, handling potentially inconsistent responses, implementing retry logic, and ensuring the returned data matches the expected structure. Security considerations for API keys add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement End-to-End Testing and Refinement",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the testing and refinement process, including test case development, LLM prompt optimization, UI/UX improvements, accessibility enhancements, and performance optimization techniques.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions (functionality, UX, accessibility, performance) and iterative refinement based on results. The complexity is high due to the breadth of testing required and the need to optimize both the UI and LLM prompts."
